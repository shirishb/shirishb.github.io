WORK EXPERIENCE
  

Team Lead, BlackBerry OS / Wireless Groups
February 2012 - January 2014 (2 years)


Led a team of 4 developers assigned to time sensitive projects in need of technical expertise and leadership
* 80%+ time spent as an active developer resource on all projects
* Exposed to agile methodologies; adopted principles from Scrum & Kanban suited to team and projects
* Managed software defect process; triage of all incoming issues, assignment and reporting
* Emphasised software quality; established clear coding guidelines; thorough design and code reviews and use of wikis, continuous integration (Jenkins), static code analysis (Klocwork), unit and functional testing tools (Check, Robot Framework)


Project: Integration of a new Wi-Fi chipset on BlackBerry10


* Managed project team of 6 developers spread across multiple development sites
* Managed relationship with a large chipset vendor and worked together to implement and support:
   * RF hardware calibration and validation at the factory
   * Station mode, Mobile Hotspot and Wi-Fi Direct/P2P functionality including Wi-Fi Display
   * Product Wi-Fi Alliance certification
* Implemented functionality between the BlackBerry proprietary WLAN Manager, customised version of the open source WPA supplicant and a network driver within the QNX io-pkt stack (based on NetBSD)
* Defined and executed processes to review, integrate and validate code releases from vendor
* Led investigation and resolution of complex system level issues ranging from subsystem interaction during startup to poor battery life performance


Key Accomplishments:


* Achieved fastest productization of a new Wi-Fi chipset on a BlackBerry phone, with KPIs (throughput, power, driver stability) meeting or exceeding mature solutions
* Championed and established processes for effective joint development with vendor


Project: Design of telephony middleware for BlackBerry10


* Managed a project team of 9 developers, a majority of whom were new to QNX and C development
* Designed and built a critical system service from the ground up which provided:
   * A framework to support call control, call history and settings for multiple phone “lines”
   * Utilities for phone number manipulation (formatting, “smart” dialling & canonical representation)
   * A cellular phone “line” (for both GSM & CDMA technologies) as per requirements from carriers
   * High availability and reliability for emergency call scenarios
* Implemented modules for a QNX Persistent Publish/Subscribe based JSON API parser/dispatcher; state machines for the phone/call and audio subsystems and other core framework components responsible for threading, event management and logging


Key Accomplishments:


* Achieved design goals of building a reliable service capable of recovery from a process crash mid-call; passed architecture review board and security research group audits with no resulting change requests
* Successfully staged deliverables to aggressively enable alpha, pre-certification and field testing
* Mentored and built an effective agile team whose “definition of done” set a high quality bar
  

Software Developer, QNX Platform Team
February 2011 - February 2012 (1 year 1 month)


* Member of a rapid prototyping team on the nascent Playbook/BlackBerry 10 platform
   * Basic Facebook functionality (get friend list, post to wall) for a native application demo
   * Driver for a tunable capacitance controller (STHVDAC-303) for a hardware team prototype
   * Networking functionality on a BlackBerry JVM on PlayBook email over Wi-Fi demo
   * Messaging, SMTP functionality on Personal Information Manager (PIM) prototype on PlayBook
  

Software Developer, WLAN Radio & IP Transport
June 2008 - February 2011 (2 years 9 months)

WLAN Protocols & Firmware Developer, Intern
May 2006 - September 2007 (1 year 4 months)


* Maintained the core Wi-Fi stack and ported multiple vendor network drivers to the BlackBerry RTOS
* Implemented standard and proprietary IEEE 802.11 features covering power management, quality of service, call admission control, regulatory domain, rate adaptation, connection and scan management
* Implemented a DNS stub resolver for the BlackBerry IPv4 stack; also maintained DHCP, ARP clients
* Experienced in IEEE 802.11 and TCP/IP protocol analysis through numerous investigations of connectivity and Wi-Fi interoperability issues reported by customers and field testers
* Devoted significant time and effort to maximising battery life performance; BlackBerry’s “always on” Wi-Fi use cases required aggressive power saving techniques with complex trade offs
* Profiled and optimised stack for CPU utilisation and throughput performance
   * Eliminated all instances where the Wi-Fi stack starved JVM UI threads beyond 60 fps budget
   * Improved average throughput on a CPU bound MSM7K platform from ~4 Mbps to ~8 Mbps
* Recognised by team for taking initiative to improve code quality and eliminating technical debt:
   * Improved module debugging capability by finding and utilising advanced logging features; e.g. logging key prints in an alternate buffer extending log history from ~2-5 mins to ~6-12 hours
   * Organised a review of all “TODO” and “FIXME” comments in code base; eliminating them while generating a list of ~30 prioritized action items in our defect tracking system
* Developed a popular tool to perform “shelving” on Perforce clients (before it was added in version 2009.2)
* Mentored new employees and delivered Wi-Fi training to remote product development sites


Key Accomplishments:


* Led efforts to port the core Wi-Fi and VPN stacks to the Qualcomm REX OS to support CDMA device variants; the resulting code reuse was considered a big win for the department, highlighted by the VP
* Led Wi-Fi development on several BlackBerry phones (Storm2, Tour2, Curve 8530, Style), from hardware bring-up of chipsets to supporting Wi-Fi Alliance certification programs


EDUCATION
